# Tangle

Tangle is an attempt at software for describing, modeling and working
with knots.


## Representation

The basic data structure is a `Loop`.  Among other things, a `Loop` is
a function that maps a `KnotParameter` to a point in three dimensional
space.

A `KnotParameter` is a floating poingt number ranging from `0.0`
(`MIN_KnotParameter`) to `1.0` (`MAX_KnotParameter`).  Arithmetic on
`KnotParameter`s is performed modulo `1.0`.

A loop is defined by a sequence of ":points of interest".  Each
`PointOfIntrerest` assiciates a `KnotParameter` with a point in space.
