    PointOfInterest

PointOfInterest represents a point on a `Loop` for which a location
has been specified.

No two points of interest should have the same KnotParameter widthin a
Loop.

No two points of interest should have equal coordinates within the
same mathematical link.

Currently, no code enforces these rules.
